1. inputted Number
2. roman numerals + their equivalents (key pair value??) [("1", "I"), ("2", "II") ... ]
3. function to convert between
    M = 1000
    C = 100 
    L = 50 
    X = 10
    V = 5
    I = 1
8 = viii
9 = ix
If smaller numbers follow larger numbers, add the numbers.For example: In the Roman numeral XII, you add 10, 1, and 1, which makes 12.

If a smaller number precedes a larger number, subtract the smaller number.For example: In the Roman numeral IV, you subtract calls 1 from 5, which makes 4.

Roman numerals don't use four identical letters in a row. For example: You'd never exceed XXX, or 10+10+10, for the tens placement. Since we can't use four identical numerals in a row, 40 would not be XXXX but, rather, XL.

Any time you see a line, that indicates the number should be multiplied by a thousand.For example: When V looks like V̅, that indicates 5 x 1000 = 5000.
Remember to treat each part of the number separately (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.).

For example: Even though 1999 is one fewer than 2000, you write MCMXCIX instead of MIM because you can’t skip place value.
